                    <p>
                      Many a times people get confused about eigenvalue
                      decomposition, and it becomes really hard to visualize how
                      eigenvectors are decomposed. But don’t worry, as we will
                      look into eigenvalue decomposition in-depth in this
                      article.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Eigenvalue decomposition is a fundamental concept in
                      linear algebra that provides a way to decompose a square
                      matrix into a set of eigenvectors and eigenvalues. It is
                      an important tool in linear algebra and its applications,
                      and it is worth spending some time to understand it
                      thoroughly.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Eigenvectors</h2>
                    <p>
                      Eigenvectors are special vectors that are stretched or
                      scaled by a matrix in a predictable way. Given a square
                      matrix <span class="math">\(A\)</span>, a non-zero vector
                      <span class="math">\(v\)</span> is an eigenvector of
                      <span class="math">\(A\)</span> if the following equation
                      holds:
                    </p>
                    <span class="math">\[Av = \lambda v\]</span>
                    <p>
                      where <span class="math">\(\lambda\)</span> is a scalar
                      called the eigenvalue corresponding to the eigenvector
                      <span class="math">\(v\)</span>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      The scalar
                      <span class="math">\(\lambda\)</span> represents the
                      amount by which the matrix
                      <span class="math">\(A\)</span> stretches or scales the
                      eigenvector <span class="math">\(v\)</span>.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Eigenvalue Decomposition</h2>
                    <p>
                      The eigenvalue decomposition of a matrix
                      <span class="math">\(A\)</span> is a decomposition of the
                      form:
                    </p>
                    <span class="math">\[Q \Lambda Q^{-1}\]</span>
                    <p>
                      where <span class="math">\(Q\)</span> is an invertible
                      matrix consisting of the eigenvectors of
                      <span class="math">\(A\)</span> , and
                      <span class="math">\(A\)</span> is a diagonal matrix whose
                      entries are the eigenvalues of
                      <span class="math">\(A\)</span>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      It is very important to note here, that the matrix
                      <span class="math">\(Q\)</span> is not necessarily always
                      symmetric, however, it needs to be invertible, in which
                      case it will have complex eigenvalues.
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>
                        Symmetric matrices:
                        <span class="math">\(Q \Lambda Q^{-T}\)</span>, where
                        <span class="math">\(Q\)</span> is orthogonal.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Hermitian matrices:
                        <span class="math">\(Q \Lambda Q^{\dagger}\)</span>,
                        where <span class="math">\(Q\)</span> is unitary.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Diagonal matrices:
                        <span class="math">\(Q \Lambda Q^{-1}\)</span>, where
                        <span class="math">\(Q\)</span> is diagonal, or
                        invertible but not necessarily orthogonal.
                      </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                      The invertible matrix <span class="math">\(Q\)</span> is
                      made up of the eigenvectors of
                      <span class="math">\(A\)</span> , and the eigenvalues are
                      stored along the diagonal of the matrix
                      <span class="math">\(A\)</span> . The eigenvalue matrix is
                      a diagonal matrix that contains the eigenvalues of a
                      square matrix <span class="math">\(A\)</span> . The
                      eigenvalue matrix can be used to represent the scaling or
                      stretching that a matrix performs on its eigenvectors.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      The determinant of a square matrix is a scalar value that
                      describes the magnitude of the scaling transformation
                      performed by the matrix. The determinant is denoted as
                      <span class="math">\( |A| \)</span> and can be computed as
                      the product of the eigenvalues of the matrix. If the
                      eigenvalues of a matrix are real and positive, then the
                      determinant is also real and positive, and it gives a
                      measure of the magnitude of the scaling transformation
                      performed by the matrix.
                    </p>
                    <span class="math">\[ det |{\lambda I - A}| = 0\]</span>
                    <p>
                      In the eigenvalue decomposition of a matrix, the
                      determinant of the matrix is equal to the product of the
                      eigenvalues of the matrix.
                      <span class="math"
                        >\[ |A| = \prod_{i=1}^{n} \lambda_i\]</span
                      >, where <span class="math">\( \lambda_i \)</span> are the
                      eigenvalues.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      This means that the determinant provides information about
                      the magnitude of the scaling transformation performed by
                      the matrix and how it affects the eigenvectors of the
                      matrix.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Determinant is also useful for solving linear systems and
                      for calculating the inverse of a matrix. If the
                      determinant of a matrix is non-zero, then the matrix is
                      invertible and the inverse of the matrix can be found
                      using the eigenvalue decomposition.

                    <h3>Properties of Eigenvalues</h3>
                    <ul>
                      <li>
                        Real Eigenvalues: The eigenvalues of a real square
                        matrix are real numbers.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Sum of Eigenvalues: The sum of the eigenvalues of a
                        matrix is equal to the trace of the matrix. This can be
                        written as:
                        <span class="math"
                          >\[ \sum_{i=1}^{n} \lambda_i = tr(A)\]</span
                        >
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Product of Eigenvalues: The product of the eigenvalues
                        of a matrix is equal to the product of the absolute
                        values of the eigenvalues. This can be written as below
                        for a real full-rank matrix:
                        <span class="math"
                          >\[ |A| = \prod_{i=1}^{n} \lambda_i\]</span
                        >
                        <p>
                          If the covariance matrices are positive semi-definite
                          (some eigenvalues might be zero), it can lead to the
                          <span class="math">\( |A| \)</span> to be zero,
                          indicating rank deficiency.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          A zero determinant means the matrix is singular
                          (non-invertible) and has at least one eigenvalue equal
                          to zero.
                        </p>

                      <li>
                        Characteristic Equation: The eigenvalues of a matrix can
                        be found by solving the characteristic equation. The
                        characteristic equation is defined as the polynomial
                        equation whose roots are the eigenvalues of the matrix.
                        The characteristic equation can be written as:
                        <span class="math">\[ det(A - \lambda I) = 0\]</span>
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Algebraic Multiplicity: The algebraic multiplicity of an
                        eigenvalue is the number of times it appears as a root
                        of the characteristic equation.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Geometric Multiplicity: The geometric multiplicity of an
                        eigenvalue is the number of linearly independent
                        eigenvectors corresponding to it.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Positive Definite: A matrix is positive definite if all

                        definite matrices are crucial in optimization and
                        machine learning as they ensure convexity in quadratic

                        Positive Semi-Definite: A matrix is positive
                        semi-definite if all eigenvalues are non-negative and at
                        least one of its eigenvalues is positive. Some

                        independent rows or columns of the matrix. It is equal
                        to te number of non-zero eigenvalues of the matrix.

                        diagonalized by an orthogonal matrix. This means that
                        the matrix can be transformed into a diagonal matrix
                        consisting of its eigenvalues by multiplying it with an
                        orthogonal matrix.

                        corresponding to the complex eigenvalues will also be
                        complex. When a real matrix has complex eigenvalues, it
                        often corresponds to a rotation-scaling transformation
                        in 2D space.

                        Eigenvectors and Diagonalization: If a matrix is
                        diagonalizable, then its eigenvectors form a basis for
                        the vector space. This means that any vector in the
                        vector space can be expressed as a linear combination of
                        the eigenvectors of the matrix.

                        Matrix Powers: The eigenvalues of a matrix are useful
                        for finding the matrix powers. For example, if

                        <span class="math">\( \lambda \)</span> is an eigenvalue
                        of <span class="math">\( A \)</span>, then
                        <span class="math">\( \lambda^k \)</span> is also an
                        eigenvalue of <span class="math">\( A^k \) </span>.

                    <h2>Applications of Eigenvalue Decomposition</h2>
                    <p>
                      Eigenvalue decomposition has a wide range of applications
                      in various fields such as image processing, computer
                      graphics, control theory, and machine learning. For
                      example, it is used in principal component analysis (PCA)
                      to reduce the dimensionality of data, in spectral
                      clustering to group similar data points, and in
                      recommendation systems to predict the ratings of items for
                      a user.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      The eigenvalue decomposition has many applications in
                      linear algebra and numerical analysis. It is used to study
                      the stability and convergence of linear systems, to find
                      the stationary points of functions, and to solve
                      differential equations. It is also used in data analysis,
                      computer graphics, and computer vision, where it is used
                      to analyze the structure of data sets and to perform
                      dimensionality reduction.

                    <p>
                      In stochastic processes, the largest eigenvalue of a
                      Markov transition matrix is always 1, and the
                      corresponding eigenvector gives the steady-state
                      distribution. This is crucial in algorithms like
                      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PageRank"
                        >Google PageRank</a
                      >, where the dominant eigenvector determines the ranking.

                      If a real 2×2 matrix has complex eigenvalues, it likely
                      represents a rotation plus scaling, which is common in
                      physics and signal processing.

                    <h2>Connection with PCA</h2>
                    <p>
                      Eigenvalue decomposition is heavily used in statistics,
                      particularly in Principal Component Analysis (PCA). For a
                      covariance matrix <span class="math">\( \Sigma \)</span> ,
                      its eigenvalues represent the variance captured in the
                      principal components, and its eigenvectors define the
                      principal directions.
                    </p>
                    <p>The covariance matrix can be decomposed as:</p>
                    <span class="math">\[ \Sigma = Q \Lambda Q^{-T} \]</span>
                    <p>
                      This ensures that the eigenvectors (principal components)
                      are orthonormal and eigenvalues represent the variance
                      along those directions.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      A key result in linear algebra is that a real symmetric
                      matrix always has real eigenvalues and an orthonormal
                      eigenvector basis.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      The
                      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectral_theorem"
                        >Spectral Theorem</a
                      >
                      states that for symmetric matrices it satisfies the
                      aforementioned equation. This guarantees that eigenvectors
                      form an orthonormal basis.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      This is especially important in statistics since
                      covariance matrices are always symmetric, meaning PCA
                      always yields real-valued principal components.

                            eigenvectors (for an

                            geometric multiplicity of an eigenvalue is smaller
                            than its algebraic multiplicity), it cannot be fully
                            diagonalized.

                          Eigenvalue Decomposition only works for Square
                          Matrices. Non-square matrices require Singular Value
                          Decomposition (SVD) instead.

                          Eigenvalues are very sensitive to perturbations. Small

                          precision errors) can drastically change eigenvalues
                          and eigenvectors.

                          If two eigenvalues are very close (near degenerate
                          eigenvalues), numerical computations may mix up
                          corresponding eigenvectors. This causes instability in
                          applications like PCA.

                      In conclusion, the eigenvalue matrix and the determinant
                      are important concepts in linear algebra and are related
                      to the eigenvalue decomposition of a matrix. The
                      eigenvalue matrix provides information about the scaling
                      transformation performed by a matrix, and the determinant
                      provides information about the magnitude of the scaling
                      transformation and its effect on the eigenvectors of the
                      matrix.
